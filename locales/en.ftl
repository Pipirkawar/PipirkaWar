# Bot localization for "Pipirik Wars" — EN.
#
# Sprint 1.5.A / dev plan 1.5.1: "All messages extracted from code".
# Foundation file: contains only keys already wired to presenters via
# `IMessageBundle`. Subsequent sprints (1.5.B+) will add the remaining
# keys and remove hardcoded strings from bot/presenters/.
#
# Conventions:
# - Keys grouped by module: `start_*`, `profile_*`, `forest_*`, etc.
# - Parameters: Fluent placeholders `{ $name }` (BCP-47 / Mozilla Fluent).
# - HTML tags allowed in values (bot uses parse_mode=HTML), but prefer
#   only `<b>`/`<i>` to keep migration to other parse_modes simple.

## /start (Sprint 1.1.C → 1.1.D → 1.2.4 DAU Gate)

start-registered = 🍆 Done! You are registered in Pipirik Wars.

    Starting length is 2 cm, thickness is level 1. Your name and title will appear later — on your first forest run.

start-already = 🍆 You are already registered. Use /profile to view your card.

start-group = 🍆 "Pipirik Wars" is here!

    1. First, register in the bot's private chat: open a DM and press /start.
    2. Then add me to a group as an admin — this turns the chat into a clan.

start-other = 🍆 "Pipirik Wars" is here. The /start command works in DM or in a group.

start-queued = 🍆 The servers are full — we've put you in the queue.

    Your position: #{ $position }.
    As soon as a slot opens up, we'll register you and send a notification.

## /profile (Sprint 1.1.E → 1.5.C)

profile-group = 🍆 The /profile command works only in the bot's DM. Open a private chat and try again.

profile-other = 🍆 The /profile command works only in the bot's DM.

profile-not-registered = 🍆 You don't seem to be registered yet. Tap /start in this chat and your card will appear.

# Localized title names from `domain.player.value_objects.Title`.
# Keys mirror enum values: `Title.NEWBIE = "newbie"` → `profile-title-newbie`.
profile-title-newbie = Newbie

# Player card from GDD §2.2. Parameters:
# - `$nick` — assembled "Title DisplayName Name" (built by presenter)
# - `$length_cm` — integer, cm
# - `$thickness_level` — integer, level
profile-card =
    🏷 { $nick }

    📏 Length: { $length_cm } cm
    📐 Thickness: { $thickness_level }

    🎽 Equipment: empty for now

## /top (Sprint 1.4.C → 1.5.C)

top-header = 🏆 <b>Pipirik Top</b>

top-empty = 🏆 The top is empty for now. Be the first — tap /start!

# Single row in the top: "<rank>. Title DisplayName Name — N cm".
top-entry = { $rank }. { $nick } — { $length_cm } cm
